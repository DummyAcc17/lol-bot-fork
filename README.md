## Welcome to LoL Bot
- This is a python bot that uses the local League Client API to start games and plays them with a simple but effective game loop.
- This bot has leveled up [thousands of league accounts](https://www.playerauctions.com/lol-account/) and is still going strong.
- No pixel botting and/or image recognition makes it easy to run on any setup.

## Requirements
- [Python >= 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [League of Legends](https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/signup/download)
- [League of Legends Account](https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/signup/index)

## Setup
- Ensure Python is added to your PATH, check "Add Python to PATH" when [installing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDbDIhR76H4)
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/iholston/lol-bot/releases)
- Download [extra RAM](https://downloadmoreram.com/) (only if needed)
- Run installer.bat or ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Optional Configuration
For Virtual Machine setups, I recommend starting with [this forum](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/league-of-legends/480977-run-league-legends-virtual-machine-vmware.html). *Note:* I will not be fixing/troubleshooting VM related issues as there are far too many VM implementation/platform specific issues

The League of Legends accounts should already have accepted the riot promise, set a username, and skipped the tutorials. The bot will automatically change your league settings/configuration and the game window (not the client) should open as a 1024x768 window
